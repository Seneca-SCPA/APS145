# Modularity with Functions

## Overview

Introduce functions...

## High-Level Functions

The concept of 'main' overall logic flow - no deep details use flowchart.

## Low-Level Functions

Full details of a focused part of logic - pseudo code.

## Passing Information

Explain how to document passing of data to a function.

## Returning Information

Explain how to return data from a function

### Explicit Return

Explain how to return explicitly - use return

### Implicit Return

Explain how to return implicitly - via argument(s)

## Typical Solution

A typical solution will contain a single flowchart describing the overall main parts of logic in the solution. It will contain references to functions where the full logic detail can be found which will be documented in pseudo code.
